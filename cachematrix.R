## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and their may be some
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly
## These functions cache the inverse of a matrix.


## The function makeCacheMatrix creates a list containing a function to
## 1. set the value of the vector
## 2. get the value of the vector
## 3. set the value of the mean
## 4. get the value of the mean

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        s <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                s <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setsolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
        getsolve <- function() s
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setsolve = setsolve,
             getsolve = getsolve)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve retrieves the 
## inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        s <- x$getsolve()
        if(!is.null(s)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(s)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        s <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setsolve(s)
        s
}
